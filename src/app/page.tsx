                            WebJam is a week-long event where students come
                            together to create fully functional web
                            applications. Whether you&apos;ve never heard of web
                            applications or built many, WebJam is here to give
                            you a platform to learn, build, and create!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the past 4 years, WebJam has focused on
                            encouraging beginners and people who are curious
                            about web technologies â€” from frontend to backend!
                            Our goal is to provide learning and networking
                            opportunities for our community of developers,
                            especially ones that come from underrepresented
                            backgrounds in the tech space.
